# self-driving-car

Hi,

This is Harin Kumar

This self driving car is developed by usind Machine Learning(ML) and not Artificial Intelligence(AI) as they have subtle differences.
An ML Agent is developed by feeding it the training data and showing it the glimpses of how driving works.
But an AI Agent is directly thrown into world and it should figure out how driving works by experimenting.

This is the same process used by TESLA and NVIDIA to design self driving cars.But this process is less complex, takes less time and not as
stable as their processes.

We start off by making a Neural Network, which is basically a bunch of perceptrons connected to one another. A Perceptron is an Artificial Neuron.So, technically, Neural Network is an Artificial Brain.

NOTE: BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING IS REQUIRED.

first off, download python version 3.5.2 from official website https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/ using this link.

then open the terminal and execute the followning commands(hit "ENTER" to execute):

    -pip3 install numpy
    -pip3 install matplotlib
    -pip3 install jupyter
    -pip3 install opencv3
    -pip3 install pillow
    -pip3 install scikit-learn
    -pip3 install scikit-image
    -pip3 install scipy
    -pip3 install h5py
    -pip3 install eventlet
    -pip3 install flask-socketio
    -pip3 install seaborn
    -pip3 install pandas
    -pip3 install imageio
    -pip3 install moviepy
    -pip3 install tensorflow==1.1
    -pip3 install keras==1.2
    
-Git clone or download this repo into your pc
-Simulator folder contains the car simulator/game
-ML Agent folder contains the ML code required
